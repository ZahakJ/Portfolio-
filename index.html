<h2>Contribution</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>For the original zelda clone I worked on all of the enemies mechanics, door transition and unlocking, as well as audio setup and initial room restart. For the new mechanic, I helped in architecting the initial room and designing the mechanic. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>I fully made Paint Path!</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Spark Shift was a 6 week major design project where I worked with 4 other students to create a beta stage 2D puzzle platformer. My role within the project moved from working on scripting the original version of the electric powered switches and doors, to implementing a new aesthetic and utilizing dynamic lighting, and finally designing the booting sequence level which served as the introduction to the game. I also worked on some animations, particle systems, and shaders.</li>
